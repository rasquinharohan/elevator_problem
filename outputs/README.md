Directory /outputs/ will contain .csv files that are written when we run the elevator problem.

There are two types of .csv files:
- elevator_states_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
  This stores the state of each elevator at each run-time state
  
- passenger_states_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
  This stores the state of each passenger at each run-time state
